      <p>
        I am an economic historian, associate professor of economics and interim director of the Benson Center at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research.
      </p>
      <p>
        My research focuses on the United States in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
        In particular, I am interested in how economic geography shapes regional development, the influence of regulation and industrial policy on market structure, and the role of human capital in labor markets.

            I teach undergraduate courses on the economic history of the <a href="/useconhist.html">United States</a> and <a href="/europe_example.pdf" target="_blank">Europe.</a> For the United States, the focus is on the interaction between economic growth and changes in inequality; for Europe, the emphasis is on the emergence of the modern economy in the context of institutional and technological change.
